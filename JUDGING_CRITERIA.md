# Judging Criteria

## Overview
These are the judging criteria we'll use to evaluate projects:

| Criterion | What We Evaluate | Score (1-5) |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Running Code** | Does the prototype run end-to-end without crashes? Are all major features functional? | 1 – Does not run at all.<br>2 – Crashes or major functionality missing.<br>3 – Runs but with significant bugs.<br>4 – Minor bugs, mostly stable.<br>5 – Fully functional, flawless execution. |
| **Use of the Stack** | How well does the solution use Redis for low-latency memory and Composio for real-world actions? Includes retrieval speed, persistence, multi-agent sharing. | 1 – No use of Redis/Composio.<br>2 – Token integration only, no real context store.<br>3 – Basic Redis store or simple API call.<br>4 – Effective memory + at least one real-world action.<br>5 – Sophisticated, sub-millisecond context pipeline, multi-agent sharing, real-time streams. |
| **Innovation & Creativity** | Novelty of idea & clever problem solving beyond existing patterns. | 1 – Straight copy of known demo.<br>2 – Minor variation of existing work.<br>3 – Some new twist.<br>4 – Clear novel approach or unique combination.<br>5 – Groundbreaking concept that pushes the field. |
| **Real-world Impact** | Potential to solve a real problem, scale, or create value for users/businesses. | 1 – Purely toy demo.<br>2 – Interesting but limited use-case.<br>3 – Solves a niche need.<br>4 – Addresses a significant market or workflow.<br>5 – Could change how organizations operate or affect many users. |
| **Theme Alignment** | How closely the project embodies "agents with super-powers": perfect recall, sub-millisecond latency, autonomous action. | 1 – Barely mentions theme.<br>2 – Superficial reference.<br>3 – Some theme elements present.<br>4 – Strong alignment, clear memory/speed/autonomy.<br>5 – Exemplifies theme perfectly, demonstrates all super-powers in a cohesive demo. |
